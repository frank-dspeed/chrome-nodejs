# chrome-nodejs
Installs ipcConnection as Chrome Extension to use System Wide Installed Chrome and NodeJS to create Apps without the need to bundle chrome and nodejs - a drop in Replacement for Electron and NWJS apps 


# Why?
As i was working on https://github.com/open-pwa/open-pwa as also electron and nwjs I regonized again that we need something that works with
nativ nodejs and nativ chrome installed system wide. as Chrome and Also Nodejs Support User Profiles for isolation this is a basic version
of that Implementation it will later get used by the open-pwa Project. 

## Future?
- Create it as Firefox extension.
- Better installers and open-pwa
